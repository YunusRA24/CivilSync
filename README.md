**Empowering young voters to connect their values with government actions**

CivilSync is a web platform that bridges the gap between what citizens care about and what their government is actually doing. Built during the University of Michigan's Data-Driven Democracy Hackathon, this tool makes civic engagement accessible and actionable for young voters.

## The Problem 🤔

Young voters want to stay informed, but:
- Executive orders and government actions are hard to track
- Political news is overwhelming and often biased
- It's difficult to know which policies actually align with your values

**CivilSync solves this by letting you compare your political views directly with presidential actions.**

## Why I Built This 💡

Democracy works best when citizens are informed, but staying up-to-date with government actions shouldn't require a political science degree. I built CivilSync during the Data-Driven Democracy Hackathon because I believe young people deserve a simple, unbiased way to understand how their government's actions align with their values.

The goal isn't to tell people what to think—it's to give them the tools to make their own informed decisions.
